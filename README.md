**Features:**

* Displays information for swimmers categorized by age group and gender.
* Showcases top times for various swimming events.
* Allows adding new members and their swim times.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3 (tested with version 3.8+)
    * A GUI library like Tkinter (comes pre-installed with most Python versions)
2. **Running the Script:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
    * Run the script using the command: `python swim_team_roster.py`

**Adding New Members:**

3. Click the "Submit" button to add the new member to the roster.

**Dependencies:**

This project relies on the Tkinter library for the GUI functionality. Make sure you have Tkinter installed with your Python version.

**Future Improvements:**

The project can be improved by incorporating more functionalities and advanced features like:

* Implementing a database to store team information more robustly.
* Adding functionalities for generating reports or exporting data.
* Designing a more visually appealing user interface.
